### Notes on data used in this book {-}

`r if (knitr::is_html_output()) {'For R, Python and Julia'} else {'For R and Python'}` users, each of the data sets used in this book can be downloaded individually by following the code in each chapter.  Alternatively, packages containing all the data sets used in this book are now available in R and Python.  For R users, install and load the `peopleanalyticsdata` R package.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install peopleanalyticsdata package
install.packages("peopleanalyticsdata")
library(peopleanalyticsdata)

# see a list of data sets
data(package = "peopleanalyticsdata")

# find out more about a specific data set ('managers' example)
help(managers)
```

For Python users , use `pip install peopleanalyticsdata` to install the package into your environment. Then, to use the package:

```{python, eval = FALSE}
# import peopleanalyticsdata package
import peopleanalyticsdata as pad
import pandas as pd

# see a list of data sets
pad.list_sets()

# load data into a dataframe
df = pad.managers()

# find out more about a specific data set ('managers' example)
pad.managers().info()

```

### Solutions to exercises {-}

It is not my intention to publish a comprehensive set of solutions to the exercises in this book.  Many of the exercises can be approached in different ways and I think it is important that readers apply their learning without being constrained to an example solution.  However, some specific questions have generated considerable interest from readers and I have started to post example solutions to those questions [here](https://keithmcnulty.github.io/peopleanalytics-regression-book/solutions/).  Illustrative solutions submitted by readers will progressively be posted there also.  


Happy modeling!
