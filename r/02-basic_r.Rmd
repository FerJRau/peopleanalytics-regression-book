# The Basics of the R Programming Language 

Most of the work in this book is implemented in the R statistical programming language which, along with Python, is one of the two languages that I use in my day-to-day statistical analysis.  Sample implementations in Python are also provided at various points in the book.  I have made efforts to keep the code as simple as possible, and where possible I have tried to avoid the use of too many external packages.  For the most part, readers should see (especially in the earlier chapters) that code blocks are short and simple, relying wherever possible on base R functionality.  No doubt there are neater and more effective ways to code some of the material in this book using a wide array of R packages - and some of these are illustrated in Chapter \@ref(alt-approaches) - but my priority has been to keep the code simple, consistent and easily reproducible.  

For those who wish to follow the method and theory without the implementations in this book, there is no need to read this chapter.  However, the style of this book is to use implementation to illustrate theory and practice, and so tolerance of many code blocks will be necessary as you read onwards.

For those who wish to simply replicate the models as quickly as possible, they will be able to avail of the code block copying feature, which appears whenever you scroll over an input code block.  Assuming all the required external packages have been installed, these code blocks should all be transportable.  For those who are extra-inquisitive and want to explore how I constructed graphics used for illustration (for which code is usually not displayed), the best place to go is the Github repository for this book. 

This chapter is for those who wish to learn the methods in this book but do not know how to use R.  However, it is not intended to be a full tutorial on R.  There are many more qualified individuals and existing resources that would better serve that purpose - in particular I recommend @wickham.  It is recommended that you consult these resources and become comfortable with the basics of R before proceeding into the later chapters of this book.  However, acknowledging that many will want to dive in sooner rather than later, this chapter covers the absolute basics of R that will allow the uninitiated reader to proceed with at least some orientation.

## What is R?

R is a programming language that was originally developed by and for statisticians, but has in recent years expanded greatly in its capabilities and the environments in which it is used, with extensive use nowadays in academia and the public and private sectors.  There are many advantages to using a programming language like R.  Here are some.

1.  It is completely free and open source.
2.  It is faster and more efficient with memory than popular graphical user interface analytics tools
3.  It facilitates easier replication of analysis from person to person compared with many alternatives
4.  It has a large and growing global community of active users
5.  It has a large and rapidly growing universe of packages which are all free and which provide the ability to do an extremely wide range of general and highly specialized tasks - both statistical and otherwise.

There is often heated debate about which languages/tools are better for doing non-trivial statistical analysis.  I personally find that R provides a wider array of resources for those interested in inferential modeling, while Python has a more well developed toolkit for predictive modeling and machine learning.  Since the primary focus of this book is inferential modeling, the in-depth walkthroughs in this book are coded in R.

## How to start using R

Just like most programming languages, R itself is an interpreter which receives input and returns output.  It is not very easy to use without an IDE.  An IDE is an *Integrated Development Environment*, which is a convenient user interface allowing an R programmer to do all their main tasks including writing and running R code, saving files, viewing data and plots, integrating code into documents and many other things.  By far the most popular IDE for R is RStudio.  An example of what the RStudio IDE looks like can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:rstudio-ide). 

```{r rstudio-ide, fig.cap="The RStudio IDE", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./www/R/rstudio-windows.png")
 
```

To start using R, follow these steps:

1.  Download and install the latest version of R from https://www.r-project.org/.  Ensure that the version suits your operating system.
2.  Download the latest version of the RStudio IDE from https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/ and view the video on that page to familiarize yourself with its features.  
3.  Open RStudio and play around.

The initial stages of using R can be challenging, mostly due to the need to become familiar with how R understands, stores and processes data. Extensive trial and error is a learning necessity.  Perseverance is important in these early stages, as well as an openness to seek help from others either in person or via online forums.

## Data in R

As you start to do tasks involving data in R, you will generally want to store the things you create so that you can refer to them later.  Simply calculating something does not store it in R.  For example, a simple calculation like this can be performed easily:

```{r}
3 + 3
```

However, as soon as the calculation is complete, it is forgotten by R because the result hasn't been assigned anywhere.  To store something in your R session, you will assign it a name using the `<-` command.  So I can assign my previous calculation to an object called `my_sum`, and this allows me to access the answer at any time.

```{r}
# store the result
my_sum <- 3 + 3

# now I can work with it
my_sum + 3
```

You will see above that you can comment your code by simply adding a `#` to the start of a line to ensure that the line is ignored by the interpreter.

Note that assignment to an object does not result in the value being displayed.  To display the value, the name of the object must be typed, the `print()` command used or the command should be wrapped in parentheses.

```{r}
# show me the value of my_sum
my_sum

# assign my_sum + 3 to new_sum and show the result
(new_sum <- my_sum + 3)
```


### Data types

All data in R has an associated type, to reflect the wide range of data that R is able to work with.  The `typeof()` function can be used to see the type of a single scalar value. Let's look at the most common scalar data types.

**Numeric data** can be in integer form or double (decimal) form

```{r}
my_integer <- 1L  #integers can be signified by adding an 'L' to the end
my_double <- 6.38

typeof(my_integer)
typeof(my_double)
```

**Character data** is text data surrounded by single or double quotes

```{r}
my_character <- "THIS IS TEXT"
typeof(my_character)
```

**Logical data** takes the form `TRUE` or `FALSE`:

```{r}
my_logical <- TRUE
typeof(my_logical)
```

### Homogeneous data structures

**Vectors** are one dimensional structures containing data of the same type and are notated by using `c()`. The type of the vector can also be viewed using the `typeof()` function, but the `str()` function can also be used to display both the contents of the vector and its type:

```{r}
my_double_vector <- c(2.3, 6.8, 4.5, 65, 6)
str(my_double_vector)
```

Categorical data - which takes only a finite number of possible values, can be stored as a factor vector to make it easier to perform grouping and manipulation:

```{r}
categories <- factor(c("Category A", "Category B", "Category C", "Category A", "Category C"))
str(categories)
```

If needed, the factors can be given order:

```{r}
# character vector 
ranking <- c("Medium", "High", "Low")
str(ranking)

# turn it into an ordered factor
ranking_factors <- ordered(ranking, levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))
str(ranking_factors)

```

The number of elements in a vector can be seen using the `length()` function:

```{r}
length(categories)
```

Simple numeric sequence vectors can be created using shorthand notation:

```{r}
(my_sequence <- 1:10)
```

If you try to mix data types inside a vector, it will usually result in *type coercion*, where one of the types is forced into a different type. Often this means the vector will become a character vector:

```{r}
# numeric sequence vector
vec <- 1:5
str(vec)

# create a new vector containing vec and the character "hello"
new_vec <- c(vec, "hello")

# numeric values have been coerced into their character equivalents
str(new_vec)
```

But sometimes logical or factor will be coerced to numeric:

```{r}
# attempt a mixed logical and numeric
mix <- c(TRUE, 6)

# logical has been converted to binary numeric (TRUE = 1)
str(mix)

# try to add a numeric to our previous categories factor vector
new_categories <- c(categories, 1)

# categories have been coerced to their background integer representations
str(new_categories)


```

**Matrices** are two-dimensional data structures of the same type, and are built from a vector by defining the number of rows and columns.  Data is read into the matrix down the columns, starting left and moving right.  Matrices are rarely used for non-numeric data types.

```{r}
# create a 2x2 matrix with the first four integers
(m <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2))
```

**Arrays** are n-dimensional data structures with the same data type, and are not used extensively by most R users.

### Heterogeneous data structures

**Lists** are one dimensional data structures that can take data of any type:

```{r}
my_list <- list(6, TRUE, "hello")
str(my_list)
```

Lists can contain any data of any dimension, each element can be given a name:

```{r}
new_list <- list(
  scalar = 6, 
  vector = c("Hello", "Goodbye"), 
  matrix = matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
)

str(new_list)
```

Named list elements can be accessed by using `$`:

```{r}
new_list$matrix
```

**Dataframes** are the most used data structure in R, and are effectively a named list of vectors of the same length, with each vector as a column.  As such, a dataframe is very similar in nature to a typical database table or spreadsheet.  

```{r}
# two vectors of different types but same length
names <- c("John", "Ayesha")
ages <- c(31, 24)

# create a dataframe
(df <- data.frame(names, ages))

# get types of columns
str(df)

# get dimensions of df
dim(df)
```

## Working with dataframes

The dataframe is the most common data structure used by analysts in R, due to its similarity to data tables found in databases and spreadsheets.  We will work almost entirely with datafames in this book, so let's get to know them.

### Loading and tidying data in dataframes

To work with data in R, you usually need to pull it in from an outside source into a dataframe^[R also has some inbuilt data sets which are for testing and playing with, for example check out `mtcars` by typing it into the terminal, or type `data()` to see a full list of in built data sets].  R facilitates numerous ways of importing data from simple csv files, from Excel files, from online sources or from databases.  In this book we will be loading all our datasets from online csv files, and the `read.csv()` function makes this easy.  Let's load a data set that we will be using later - the `salespeople` data set, which contains some information on the sales, average customer ratings and performance ratings of salespeople.  The `read.csv()` function can accept a URL address of the file if it is online.

```{r}
# url of data set 
url <- "http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/data/salespeople.csv"

# load the dataset and store it as a dataframe called salespeople
salespeople <- read.csv(url)
```

We might not want to display this entire dataset before knowing how big it is.  We can view the dimensions and if it is too big to display, we can use the `head()` function to display just the first few rows.

```{r}
dim(salespeople)

# view first few rows
head(salespeople)
```


We can view a specific column by using `$`, and we can use square brackets to view a specific entry.   For example if we wanted to see the 6th entry of the `sales` column:

```{r}
salespeople$sales[6]
```

Alternatively we can use a `[row, column]` index to get a specific entry in the dataframe.

```{r}
salespeople[34, 4]
```


We can take a look at the data types using `str()`

```{r}
str(salespeople)
```

We can also see a statistical summary of each column using `summary()`, which tells us various statistics depending on the type of the column.

```{r}
summary(salespeople)
```

Note that there is missing data in this dataframe, indicated by `NA`s in the summary.  Missing data is identified by a special `NA` value in R.  This should not be confused with `"NA"`, which is simply a character string.  The function `is.na()` will look at all values in a vector or dataframe and return `TRUE` or `FALSE` based on whether they are `NA` or not.  By adding these up using the `sum()` function, it will take `TRUE` as 1 and `FALSE` as 0, which effectively provides a count of missing data.

```{r}
sum(is.na(salespeople))
```

This is a small number of `NA`s given the dimensions of our data set and we might want to remove the rows of data that contain NAs.  The easiest way is to use the `complete.cases()` function, which identifies the rows that have no `NA`s, and then we can select those rows from the dataframe based on that condition.  Note that you can overwrite objects with the same name in R.

```{r}
salespeople <- salespeople[complete.cases(salespeople), ]

# confirm no NAs
sum(is.na(salespeople))
```

We can see the unique values of a vector or column using the `unique()` function.

```{r}
unique(salespeople$performance)
```

If we need to change the type of a column in a dataframe, we can use the `as.numeric()`, `as.character()`, `as.logical()` or `as.factor()` functions.  For example, given that there are only four unique values for the `performance` column, we may want to convert it to a factor.

```{r}
salespeople$performance <- as.factor(salespeople$performance)
str(salespeople)
```

### Manipulating dataframes

Dataframes can be subsetted to contain only rows that satisfy specific conditions:

```{r}
sales_720 <- subset(salespeople, subset = sales == 720)
```

Note the use of `==` which is used in many programming languages to test for precise equality.  Similarly we can select columns based on inequalities (`>` for 'greater than', `<` for 'less than', `>=` for 'greater than or equal to', `<=` for 'less than or equal to', or `!=` for 'not equal to').  For example:

```{r}
high_sales <- subset(salespeople, subset = sales >= 700)
head(high_sales)
```

To select specific columns use the `select` argument:

```{r}
salespeople_sales_perf <- subset(salespeople, select = c("sales", "performance"))
head(salespeople_sales_perf)
```

Two dataframes with the same column names can be combined by their rows:

```{r}
low_sales <- subset(salespeople, subset = sales < 400)

# bind the rows of low_sales and high_sales together
low_and_high_sales = rbind(low_sales, high_sales)
head(low_and_high_sales)
```

Two dataframes with different column names can be combined by their columns:

```{r}
# two dataframes with two columns each
sales_perf <- subset(salespeople, select = c("sales", "performance"))
prom_custrate <- subset(salespeople, select = c("promoted", "customer_rate"))

# bind the columns to create a dataframe with four columns
full_df <- cbind(sales_perf, prom_custrate)
head(full_df)
```

## Functions, packages and libraries

In the code so far we have used a variety of functions.  For example `head()`, `subset()`, `rbind()`.  Functions are operations that take certain defined inputs and return an output.  Functions exist to perform common useful operations.

### Using functions

Functions usually take one or more arguments.  Often there are a large number of arguments that a function can take, but many are optional and not required to be specified by the user,  For example, the function `head()`, which displays the first rows of a dataframe^[It actually has a broader definition but is mostly used for showing the first rows of a dataframe], has only one required argument `x`: the name of the dataframe.  A second argument is optional, `n`: the number of rows to display.  If `n` is not entered, it is assumed to have the default value `n = 6`.  

When running a function, you can either specify the arguments by name or you can enter them in order without their names.  If you enter then without their names, R expects the arguments to be entered in exactly the right order.

```{r}
# see the head of salespeople, with the default of six rows
head(salespeople)

# see fewer rows - arguments need to be in the right order if not named
head(salespeople, 3)

# or if you don't know the right order, name your arguments and you can put them in any order
head(n = 3, x = salespeople)
```

### Help with functions

Most functions in R have excellent help documentation.  To get help on the `head()` function, type `help(head)` or `?head`.  This will display the results in the Help browser window in RStudio.  Alternatively you can open the `Help` browser window directly in RStudio and do a search there. An example of the browser results for `head()` is in Figure \@ref(fig:head-help).

```{r head-help, fig.cap="Results of a search for the `head()` function in the RStudio Help browser", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./www/R/head-help.png")
```

The help page normally shows the following:

* Description of the purpose of the function
* Usage examples, so you can quickly see how it is used
* Arguments list so you can see the names and order of arguments
* Details or notes on further considerations on use
* Expected value of the output (for example `head()` is expected to return a similar object to its first input `x`)
* Examples to help orient you further (sometimes examples can be very abstract in nature and not so helpful to users)

### Installing packages

All the functions that we have used so far exist in the base R installation.  However, the beauty of open source languages like R is that users can write their own functions or resources and release them to others via packages.  A package is an additional module that can be installed easily and which makes resources available which are not in the base R installation.  In this book we will be using functions from both base R and from popular and useful packages.  As an example, a popular package used for statistical modelling is the `MASS` package, which is based on methods in a popular applied statistics book^[@ripley].  

Before an external package can be used, it must be installed into your package library using `install.packages()`.  So to install `MASS`, type `install.packages("MASS")` into the console.  This will send R to the main internet repository for R packages (known as CRAN), it will find the right version of `MASS` for your operating system and download and install it into your package library.  If `MASS` needs other packages in order to work, it will also install these packages.  

If you want to install more than one package, put the names of the packages inside a character vector - for example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_packages <- c("MASS", "DescTools", "dplyr")
install.packages(my_packages)
```

Once you have installed a package, you can see what functions are available by calling for help on it, for example using `help(package = MASS)`.

### Using packages

Once you have installed a package into your package library, to use it in your R session you need to load it using the  `library()` function. For example, to load `MASS` after installing it, use `library(MASS)`.  Often nothing will happen when you use this command, but rest assured the package has been loaded and you can start to use the functions inside it.  Sometimes when you load the package a series of messages will display, usually to make you aware of certain things that you need to keep in mind when using the package.  Note that whenever you see the `library()` command in this book, it is assumed that you have already installed the package in that command.  If you have not, the `library()` command will fail.

Once a package is loaded from your library, you can use any of the functions inside it.  For example, the `stepAIC()` function is not available before you load the `MASS` package but becomes available after it is loaded.  In this sense, functions 'belong' to packages.

Problems can occur when you load packages that contain functions with the same name as functions that already exist in your R session.  Often the messages you see when loading a package will alert you to this.  When R is faced with a situation where a function exists in multiple packages you have loaded, R always defaults to the function in *the most recently loaded* package.  This may not always be what you intended.

One way to completely avoid this issue is to get in the habit of *namespacing* your functions.  To namespace, you simply use `package::function()`, so to safely call `stepAIC()` from `MASS`, you use `MASS::stepAIC()`.  Most of the time in this book when a function is being called from a package outside base R, I use namespacing to call that function.  This should help avoid confusion about which packages are being used for which functions.

### The pipe operator

Even in the most elementary briefing about R, it is very difficult to ignore the pipe operator.  The pipe operator makes code more natural to read and write and reduces the typical computing problem of many nested operations inside parentheses.  The pipe operator comes inside many R packages, particularly `magrittr` and `dplyr`.

As an example, imagine we wanted to do the following two operations in one command:

1. Subset `salespeople` to only the `sales` values of those with `sales` less than 500
2. Take the mean of those values

In base R, one way to do this is:

```{r}
mean(subset(salespeople$sales, subset = salespeople$sales < 500))
```

This is nested, and needs to be read from the inside out in order to align with the instructions.  The pipe operator `%>%` takes the command that comes before it and places it inside the function that follows it (by default as the first argument). This reduces complexity and allows you to follow the logic more clearly:

```{r}
# load magrittr library to get the pipe operator
library(magrittr)

# use the pipe operator to lay out the steps more logically
subset(salespeople$sales, subset = salespeople$sales < 500) %>% 
  mean() 

```

This can be extended to perform arbitrarily many operations in one piped command:

```{r}
subset(salespeople$sales, subset = salespeople$sales < 500) %>% # get the subsetted data
  mean() %>% # take the mean value
  round() # round to the nearest integer

```

The pipe operator is unique to R and is very widely used because it helps to make code more readable, it reduces complexity, and it helps orient around a common "grammar" for the manipulation of data.  The pipe operator helps you to structure your code more clearly around nouns (objects), verbs (functions) and adverbs (arguments of functions).  One of the most developed sets of packages in R that follows these principles is the `tidyverse` family of packages, which I encourage you to explore.

## Errors, warnings and messages

As I mentioned earlier in this chapter, getting familiar with R can be frustrating at the beginning if you have never programmed before.  You can expect to regularly see messages, warnings or errors in response to your commands.  I encourage you to regard these as your friend rather than your enemy.  It is very tempting to take the latter approach when you are starting out, but over time I hope you will appreciate some wisdom from my words.

*Errors* are serious problems which usually result in the halting of your code and a failure to return your requested output.  They usually come with an indication of the source of the error and these can sometimes be easy to understand and sometimes frustratingly vague and abstract.  For example, an easy to understand error is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
subset(salespeople, subset = sales = 720)
```

```
Error: unexpected '=' in "subset(salespeople, subset = sales ="
```

This helps you see that you have used `sales = 720` as a condition to subset your data, when you should have used `sales == 720` for precise equality.

A much more challenging error to understand is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
head[salespeople]
```
```
Error in head[salespeople] : object of type 'closure' is not subsettable
```

When first faced with an error that you can't understand, try not to get frustrated and proceed in the knowledge that it usually can be fixed easily and quickly.  Often the problem is much more obvious than you think, and if not, there is still a 99% likelihood that others have made this error and you can read about it online.  The first step is to take a look at your code to see if you can spot what you did wrong.  In this case you may see that you have used square brackets `[]` instead of parentheses`()` when calling your `head()` function.  If you cannot see what is wrong, the next step is to ask a colleague or do an internet search with the text of the error message you receive, or to consult online forums like https://stackoverflow.com.  The more experienced you become, the easier it is to interpret error messages.

*Warnings* are less serious and usually alert you to something that you might be overlooking and which could indicate a problem with the output.  In many cases you can ignore warnings, but sometimes they are an important reminder to go back and edit your code.  For example, you may run a model which doesn't converge, and while this does not stop R from returning results, it is also very useful for you to know that it didn't converge.  

*Messages* are pieces of information that may or may not be useful to you at a particular point in time.  Sometimes you will receive messages when you load a package from your library.  Sometimes messages will keep you up to date on the progress of a process that is taking a long time to execute.
