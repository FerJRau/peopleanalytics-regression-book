# Solutions to Exercises {-}

It is not my intention to publish a comprehensive set of solutions to the exercises in this book.  Many of the exercises can be approached in different ways and I think it is important that readers apply their learning without being constrained to an example solution.  

However, I have made a place available where readers can contribute their solutions to exercises for the benefit of other readers.  If you are interested in seeing submitted solutions, or requesting or submitting a solution yourself, please visit   [https://solutions.peopleanalytics-regression-book.org](https://solutions.peopleanalytics-regression-book.org). 

I encourage you to contibute your learnings and expertise by considering submitting a solution to a discussion question or data exercise.  

Happy modeling!
