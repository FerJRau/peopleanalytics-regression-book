Chapter 3 Exercise 9 Solution
================
Keith McNulty

**Question:** By using an appropriate hypothesis test, determine if the
age of those who have recently donated is at least 10 years older than
those who have not recently donated in the population.

**Solution:** Let \(x_1\) be the vector of ages of those who have
recently donated and let \(x_0\) be the vector of ages of those who have
not recently donated.

``` r
#get data
url <- "http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/data/charity_donation.csv"
donation <- read.csv(url)


x1 <- subset(donation, subset = recent_donation == 1, select = "age")
x0 <- subset(donation, subset = recent_donation == 0, select = "age")
```

We are trying to establish if \(\bar{x_1} - 10 > \bar{x_0}\) in the
population. Alternatively stated, we are testing if
\(\overline{x_1 - 10} > \bar{x_0}\) in the population, so we are doing a
\(t\)-test in our sample to compare `x1 - 10` with `x0`. Also, since we
are testing for “greater than”, we need to use a one-sided \(t\)-test
with “greater” as the alternative hypothesis:

``` r
t.test(x1 - 10, x0, alternative = "greater")
```

    ## 
    ##  Welch Two Sample t-test
    ## 
    ## data:  x1 - 10 and x0
    ## t = 5.2268, df = 105.15, p-value = 4.403e-07
    ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is greater than 0
    ## 95 percent confidence interval:
    ##  7.162817      Inf
    ## sample estimates:
    ## mean of x mean of y 
    ##  52.68675  42.19188

The p-value of this test confirms that those who donated are at least
ten years older than those who did not.
